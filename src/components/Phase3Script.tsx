Analyze the following premise:
"What if a high-ranking corporate saboteur is forced to execute a quiet chemical poisoning during a high-stakes dinner inside a smart, hermetic greenhouse that visually manifests human stress hormones?"

Generate THREE distinct narrative directions for this setup. For each option, you must output a raw, well-structured JSON block matching this exact structural schema. 

Note that character generation is separated from cosmology to ensure maximum psychological depth. Character profiles must be written as modular, self-contained "Lego Bricks" that combine McKee's internal character dimensions with direct physical, kinetic, and voice API rendering telemetry:

Your task is to expand this concept into a tightly proportional, multi-sequence framework spanning all three acts. You are strictly forbidden from leaving "story vacuums" in Act 1 or Act 3. 

Every scene in your sequence map and every beat in your beat sheet must refer directly to the character Lego blocks by their unique ID (e.g., "char_1", "char_2") to ensure perfect structural consistency.

In building the beats, you must actively utilize each character's "kinetics" (gesture vocabulary, micro-movements, reaction tempo) and transition their vocal "state_telemetry" (neutral_state, tension_state, panic_state) alongside McKee's value shifts.

const PHASE_3_PROMPT = `We are proceeding to PHASE 5: THE SCRIPT EXECUTION. 

Here is our locked, consolidated Pre-Production JSON Blueprint:
[PASTE COPIED BLUEPRINT JSON FROM PHASE 2 HERE]

Write the final, production-ready screenplay based strictly on this data structure. Adhere to the following structural and stylistic execution laws:

1. FORMAT: Use flawless, standard screenplay layout. Use uppercase for CHARACTER NAMES in dialogue headings and action line introductions. Use parentheticals only to denote active subtextual transitions and physical vocal delivery states, not literal physical actions.
2. DIALOGUE SUBTEXT CONSTRAINT: Every line of spoken text must act as a diplomatic surface mask. Dialogue must naturally deliver the exact step-by-step psychological agendas mapped out in your "beats" behavioral gerund tags. Characters must never speak their inner truths until the script hits the raw, mask-shattering explosion of the Story Climax.
3. KINETIC PHYSICALITY: Weave each character's kinetic profile (posture, gait, gestures, and reaction tempo) directly into the action blocks to visually ground the performance for the camera. 
4. VOCAL STATE PARENTHETICALS: Translate the active "vocal_state" (neutral_state, tension_state, panic_state) from your beats array into precise parentheticals. Use the exact "stress_cues" text (e.g., "voice cracking", "shallow rapid breathing") to define how the dialogue is delivered.
5. FRENCH SCENES: Advance the scene's internal rhythm and tempo every single time a character enters, exits, or radically alters the power dynamics of the room.
6. VARIATION: Alternate rapid, visual action blocks describing environmental and physical changes with expansive, emotionally dense subtextual confrontations.
7. THEMATIC TRANSITIONS: Link consecutive scenes using a clean sensory hinge (a shared object, an opposing quality of light, a sound bridge, or a word contrast) as defined in the playbook.

Include the visual_flora color shifts (e.g., violet, pale yellow, mottled, defensive crimson) in the action blocks to visually represent the characters' sweat and adrenaline changes. Begin the script immediately.`;
